Dataset: 
We used HPMS data from the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 to analyze pavement roughness, and climate data and incorporated socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates to explore patterns in pavement conditions across different socioeconomic contexts. Due to missing ACS data for 2020 at the time of publication, we imputed values by taking the mean of the 2019 and 2021 datasets. Each yearâ€™s HPMS and ACS data were merged individually, and the combined yearly datasets were then concatenated to form a unified dataset for conducting the two-step cluster analysis.

Dataset: 
We again utilized HPMS data from 2017, 2018, and 2019, incorporating variables such as the International Roughness Index (IRI), base, rigid, and flexible pavement thickness, surface type, and functional system classifications. For this phase, we also included socioeconomic variables from the ACS 5-Year Estimates to examine pavement condition patterns in various socioeconomic contexts. Missing values were addressed using linear interpolation, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess relationships among the variables.
