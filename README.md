# Title: AI-Driven Pavement Analytics: Enhancing Network Maintenance and Optimization

## Chapter 1: Socioeconomic Considerations in Decision-making 

Data Analytical Methods: Two-step-Clustering for Pattern Analysis, Correlation Analysis for Feature Selections, Linear Interpolations for Handeling Missing Values 

### Winter Simulation 2024 Conference
Paper: Uncovering Socioeconomic Features in Pavement Conditions Through Data Mining: A Two-Step Clustering Model 

Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10838835 

Dataset: 
We used HPMS data from the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 to analyze pavement roughness, and climate data and incorporated socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates to explore patterns in pavement conditions across different socioeconomic contexts. Due to missing ACS data for 2020 at the time of publication, we imputed values by taking the mean of the 2019 and 2021 datasets. Each yearâ€™s HPMS and ACS data were merged individually, and the combined yearly datasets were then concatenated to form a unified dataset for conducting the two-step cluster analysis.

Paper: Paving Equity: Unveiling Socioeconomic Patterns in Pavement Conditions Using Data Mining (Accepeted)

Dataset: 
We again utilized HPMS data from 2017, 2018, and 2019, incorporating variables such as the International Roughness Index (IRI), base, rigid, and flexible pavement thickness, surface type, and functional system classifications. For this phase, we also included socioeconomic variables from the ACS 5-Year Estimates to examine pavement condition patterns in various socioeconomic contexts. Missing values were addressed using linear interpolation, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess relationships among the variables. 


## Chapter 2: Justice Consideration in Infrastructure Mangement

Data Analytical Methods: Natural Language Processing, Topic Modeling and Geospatial Analysis for Systematic Review 

### ASCE-ICTD 2025 Conference
Paper: Equitable Infrastructure Management: A Systematic Literature Review

Link: (under process) 

Datasets: 
We initially reviewed 1,405 papers from Scopus based on relevant keywords. Following an extensive screening process, 295 papers were shortlisted for consideration in this conference. Ultimately, 272 papers were selected to analyze the socioeconomic dimensions of infrastructure management, with a particular focus on equitable infrastructure development and the broader themes of equity and justice for all.
